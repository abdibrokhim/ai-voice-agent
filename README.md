Matching text content: **Personalize the demo experience**
The first step is understanding what your customers actually need. One way to do this is by mapping demos to key moments in your customer lifecycle journey. Is the demo part of your new user onboarding sequence or feature activation campaign? Or is the demo part of your knowledge base to help with troubleshooting issues?
**By targeting ‘immediate’ requirements, you give customers what they need — holding on to their interest until they reach the AHA moment.** So they realize the value of your solution or feature.
Another way to personalize the demo experience is audience segmentation, either based on Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) or user activity, so you’re relevant. For example, let’s say you’re a subscription billing platform that has two buyer personas — finance teams and sales teams.
Instead of sharing a generic demo with each of them, you can create custom demos addressing their unique pain points. Like financial reporting for finance teams, and contract management for sales teams.
